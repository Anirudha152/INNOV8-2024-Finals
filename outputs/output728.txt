## Education:
- Associate of Science : Electronic Engineering :: Florence Darlington Technical School

## Experience:
- Information Technology :: I was hired to manage accreditation efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3 accreditation packages each leading to successful Authorization To Operate decisions. Responsibilities then increased to include all departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful ATOs. Now, working on 4 new accreditation including re-authorization for an existing project. Succeeded in writing and implementing vulnerability management for existing accredited systems. Success of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in critical design decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise business model to understand the best fit for the program. The different projects required careful management of specific STIG compliance and hardening for the different configurations and services required for the specific domain to be integrated.   Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and risk.   Supervised 5 external computer consultants and vendors.   Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and network configuration.
- Systems Engineer :: I was Hired to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements. Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product problems and strengths and collected data on customer experience  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new technology for supporting new processing needs thru proper processing power.  The next challenge  came as storage requirements for better performance and more controlled uses. After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB. In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and accredited for operation in the Enterprise.  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from 30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.
- Senior Systems Analyst :: I was hired to improve corporate and client communications and processing requirements which resulted in the design, build and deployment of 3 Enterprise network solutions. One solution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington Navy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii support facilities. Fulfilled requirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware weaknesses and developing preventive strategies and solutions for avoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru documenting system layouts, wiring diagrams and addressing schema to understand layouts and make informed solutions to upper management.
