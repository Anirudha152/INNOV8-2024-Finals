## Education:
- Electrical Engneering :: University of Texas at Arlington
- Certificate of Completion : Officer Candidate School (BOOST) :: Officer Training/College Prep

## Experience:
- Electrical Engineer :: Practical application of Electrical Engineering Critical thinking that involves the use of logic and reasoning to identify the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions to problems Prepared and studied technical schematics and P&ID drawings and specifications of electrical/electromechanical systems to ensure that installations and operations conform to standards and customer requirements Diverse knowledge of frac pump components and assembly Instrumentation and controls applications Proficient in the design codes and standards of the SAE, NEC, NEMA, IEEE and ANSI Designed custom enclosures, consoles and cable/harnesses per UL and NEMA Standards Designed power DCS systems for frac fleet in compliance with SAE, IEEE, NEMA and ANSI standards and codes Created cable schedule spreadsheets, requirements documents and operations manuals for product/project transparency Created BOM's and routings in Microsoft Dynamics GP for development of manufacturing build orders Implemented NEC guidelines on electrical designs and schematics and created assembly instructions and testing procedures in compliance to HSE and OSHA Standards Managed assembly and field tech personnel during project phases and established reliable and competitive vendor/contractor relationships for project commissioning achieving a margin of 30% savings in company spending Managed Chemical 6 (C6) Unit Project from inception to completion for C&J Energy Services frac fleet and reduced downtime by 40% Managed Hydration Unit Project from inception to completion for C&J Energy Services frac fleet and reduced downtime by 20% Managed Dual Fluid Pumper (DFP) Unit Project from inception to completion for NITRO Drilling Services frac fleet and increased revenue potential by 100% Managed the R&D Frac Pump Testing facility project for the High Pressure and Low Pressure Loop cells from inception to completion for Weir SPM and increased testing efficiency from 40% to 100%
- Manufacturing Engineer :: Implemented pump test design changes that eliminated downtown by 80% and increase test output efficiency by 86% Implemented pump testing set up and break-down procedures that effectively resulted in a 20% decrease in LTI's (Lost Time Incident) Designed MCC for control of 7500 hp WEG motor and vfd that resulted in a 50% output increase of tested pumps Designed power distribution and control for medium and high voltage motors and vfd's for hydraulic lube circuits: supply and cooling loops Designed power distribution and control for medium and high voltage motors and vfd's for water circuits: supply and cooling loops Designed new tooling for Autofrettage, Pump Assembly and Pump Test that was more ergonomically efficient for operators and mechanics that resulted in a decrease of process bottleneck of 10% Managed frac pump testing facility with essential upgrades to allow company to effectively test 250 pumps per month with no equipment downtime or failure increasing output efficiency to 86% Designed tooling fixtures and had ergonomically efficient equipment installed to LEAN Pump Assembly, Pump Paint and Autofrettage areas averaging a 10% increase in work output for all areas combined Managed the Williston Service Center Frac Pump Testing facility project for the High Pressure Loop cell from inception to completion reducing testing cost by $10k per test per month maintenance
- Maintenance Mechanic MPE-9 :: Troubleshot and repaired mail processing equipment that consisted of vfd's, SLC500 PLC's, Baldor motors, Eaton gearboxes and MCC panels by aid of multi-meter and/or RS Logix software. Performed periodic maintenance tasks on all mail processing equipment. Operated SCADA systems that controlled mail processing equipment.
- Aviation Electrician Petty Officer 3rd Class :: Aircraft handler duties consisting of taxing, securing and preparing aircraft for launch from aircraft carrier(USS Nimitz CVN-68). Troubleshot and repaired electrical circuit boards, gyros, joysticks, control panel instrumentation for all onboard aircraft consisting of F-18 Hornet, F-16 Tomcat, EA6B Prowler and H60 Helicopter to ensure operational readiness for ship and crew.
