## Experience:
- Floater/Teacher :: Work with/teach children from ages 6 weeks to Pre-K.   Enforce rules for behavior and procedures for maintaining order among classes. Show love and compassion to the children on a daily basis. Teach the children God's love through my interactions with them and by giving positive praise and affection.  Work with/Assist the classroom teachers by following their schedules and lesson plans. 
- Physical Education and Health Teacher :: As the Physical Education teacher, I taught 60 minute Physical Education classes to kindergarten, first, third, fourth, and fifth grade students. Along with Physical Education, my classes also included anatomy (muscle and bone) and nutrition. Safety in the gym/field/classroom was emphasized on a daily basis.  lesson plans were developed in accordance to the unit plan for the semester. Critical thinking questions and/or scenarios were created and implemented for the students to use on a daily basis. Assessments were done on a bi-monthly basis through various methods such as; paper and pencil assessment, peer assessment, and teacher evaluations. As the Health Education teacher I would teach 60 minute classes to third, fourth, and fifth grade students.  I created an outline/proposal for the Health class and was granted the opportunity to begin this first ever Health class/curriculum. I assessed the students through group projects and daily "pop quiz's" at the beginning of each new lesson. 
- Children's Fitness Instructor/Manager :: As a Children's Fitness Instructor I taught physical education and nutrition classes to children ages 18 months to 5 years old.  I made my classes fun and engaging in an environment that was positive and nurturing.  Safety was a top priority in my classes. I used positive reinforcement and redirection in order to avoid any behavior or discipline issues.  I was promoted to Manager for Stretch-n-Grow in August of 2013 During my time as Manager I would hire any new coaches we needed and kept them organized and prepared to teach their classes.  I made the weekly schedules and checked in with directors of schools in order to find out how my coaches were performing and if there were any issues that needed to be worked out or any special praises that needed to be given for going above and beyond.  I was organized and professional during my time as manager which helped keep my coaches organized and professional and schools happy with our program.  I kept communication open on a daily basis with my coaches through emails, phone calls, texts, meetings, and making myself easily approachable.
