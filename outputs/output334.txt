## Experience:
- Professional Fitness Trainer, Group Instructor ::  I lead group and private classes. Classes at Wellfit Malibu include HiiT (High Intensity Interval Training, Strength Training,Kick boxing, Circuit Training, Plyometrics and Agility Training, Aqua Fitness and Restorative Stretch classes. I am also responsible for administering the guests Test In and Test Outs using our InBody machine which records their body fat percentage, lean muscle mass, water levels, etc.. I take their measurements and explain their results to them for their future use in their fitness and nutrition journey. For those looking for a more in depth look at their fitness levels I can give them aVO2 Max and/or RMR testing at Wellfit Malibu. Most of all I enjoy helping and watching our guests transform physically, emotionally and spiritually right before my eyes. It is exciting to see what people can accomplish when they trust the support system around them and when they truly start to believing in themselves and their abilities.
- Manager/Certified Personal Trainer :: My daily responsibilities as an Office Manager include; answering the phones, scheduling appointments for our Chiropractors, Physical Therapists, Massage Therapists, our Acupuncturist, our Skin Specialist and my own clients for Fitness Training. I am also required to keep the office accounting and insurance billing up to date. I order, label, sell and stock retail products as well as keep the office clean and efficient at all times. My goal is to provide a smooth running and well-balanced environment for both the patients and employees. As a certified fitness trainer my expertise has evolved by working with all different types of people; the young, the elderly, the weak, the strong, the couch potato, the professional athlete, the stay at home mom/dad, the workaholic, the rich and famous and the down to earth, all who have a similar goal in mind - Strength and fitness for a healthy lifestyle. I developed of a beach workout called "Beach Plyo" which incorporates cardio, plyometric training, endurance, strength training and coordination.   It is a total body workout in the soft sand which utilizes weighted balls, hurdles, ladders, plyometric jump boxes, exercise bands, etc..  It is an intense class for those seeking something off the main grid and want a bit of a challenge. I have also developed specific programs for the elderly so that they stay mentally and physically fit therefore preventing injury and/or illness. In geriatric training there are two main focuses: Balance/Gait and muscle development. Through exercise routines consisting of standing balancing exercises, vision exercises, water therapy, walking, stationary cycling, yoga, pilates, tai chi and basic strength exercises they can accomplish increased muscle  strength, bone strength and their ability to walk and move. By keeping them active and physically strong improves their overall quality of life. I have also taught, coached and trained young children and teenagers in specific sports as well as for overall fitness. I have coached kids in track and field, soccer, softball, swimming and cross country. I love the simple competitive nature of kids. I enjoy finding ways to keep them motivated while keeping it fun. It is incredibly rewarding to watch them reaching goals they never thought was possible. Being a fitness trainer allows me to share my knowledge and experience with others and it also keeps me focused, balanced and organized. I have chosen an overall healthy lifestyle that I believe is inspirational to those I train plus it gives me the energy I need to give them my absolute best.
- Massage Therapist :: I owned and managed an independent massage therapy business out of the Total Woman Gym in my hometown of Ventura, CA. I would advertise for my business and maintain a clean and serene massage therapy room with fresh linens and aromatherapy. As a Massage Therapist I enjoyed connecting with people in a therapeutic and professional manner.
- Professional Triathlete :: I had the privilege of working and training with performance experts in track and field, swimming and cycling and triathlon. My sponsors consisted of Saucony running shoes, Oakley sunglasses, Danskin performance wear, Power Bar, Hamilton Bikes (now Easton), and Impex (a Japanese Nutrition company).
- Hostess :: My duties included setting up tables and stations for service, answering phone calls, making reservations, tasting food for quality and presentation and seating our guests in the appropriate sections. I really enjoyed working in an upscale restaurant where I had to exude confidence, poise and a positive attitude along with an excellent knowledge of food service.
- Membership Manager :: This job required many phone calls and meetings with new and existing members. I would make sure they were content with their membership and their experience in our gym. I truly loved working with people of all ages on a daily basis and making sure that all their needs were met.
