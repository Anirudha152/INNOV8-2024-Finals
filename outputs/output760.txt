## Education:
- Bachelor of Science : Technical Management / Occupational Safety and Health :: Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
- Associate of Science : Aviation Technology and Healthy Technology :: Coastline Community College

## Experience:
- Aviation Mechanic :: Orchestrate aircraft maintenance activity across 12 work centers, supervising 200+ technicians in testing, troubleshooting, and upkeep of aircraft and engine subsystems on both fixed and rotor-wing models. Direct organizational-level and intermediate-level maintenance programs; implement policies, improve processes, and provide technical supervision and management control of programs impacting aircraft maintenance activities. Drive production quality control and administrative audits; collect, analyze, and interpret test data to provide senior leadership with crucial guidance for improving operational efficiency and performance. Key Contributions: Established schedules, organized workloads,and led multi-functional team to meet aggressive production timelines.  Completed 2,200 maintenance actions to keep seven H-60R/S helicopters, three P-8A, and two E-2D aircraft at peak airworthiness and operational readiness. Supervised all aspects of maintenance including calibration, repair, and replacement of damaged or unserviceable parts, components, and assemblies.  Overcame lack of available resources by manufacturing parts in-house, ensuring compliance with stringent specifications, tolerances, and quality standards. Steered development of logistics plans and documentation for implementing and sustaining P-8A logistics programs.  Conducted comprehensive evaluation of maintenance concept and tasks, logistics resources, and current policies and processes.  Isolated supportability / depot issues impacting P-8A program, and devised sound solutions, alternatives, and recommendations for achieving program objectives.
- Aviation Mechanic :: Skillfully performed scheduled / unscheduled and preventative maintenance across variety of aircraft models; led troubleshooting, removal, repair, modification, calibration, assembly, and quality assurance of mechanical and electrical systems, subsystems, airframes, power plants, engines, hydraulics, avionics, and associated support equipment (SE). Coordinated with technicians from multiple shops to drive work sequencing, scheduling, and priority changes; adapted procedures and resources to resolve problems arising from equipment failures, material delays, and labor shortages. Trained employees and inspected finished work to ensure adherence with quality standards; documented maintenance activity and submitted reports on schedule. Key Contributions: Demonstrated exceptional skill in diagnosing, isolating, and correcting technical problems, executing repairs and replacements quickly to minimize aircraft downtime. Interpreted and utilized maintenance instruction manuals, blueprints, schematics, and technical publications in conjunction with variety of test equipment including mechanical rpm test sets, engine, propeller, and turbine Vibration Analysis Test Set (VATS). Provided accountability for budgets, materials, inventories, and documentation; ensured all internal controls were in place and complied with to ensure transparency.  Enforced foreign object damage (FOD), hazardous waste, and tool control programs. Drew upon strong training and performance evaluation skills; coached, mentored, and guided junior mechanics to earn critical qualifications and meet performance standards.
