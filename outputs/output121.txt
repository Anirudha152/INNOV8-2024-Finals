The employee may adapt and implement systems diagnostic and maintenance tools to ensure the availability and functionality of systems required to support organizational Objectives and evaluate and recommend selection of new systems diagnostic tools. This work affects the availability of IRS IT systems needed to meets the mission requirements. Regular contacts include employees in the same or related units, employees and managers within IRS and contractors/vendors at several levels of the agency (campuses, headquarters or field offices); and individuals or groups from outside the agency, including consultants, contractors, vendors, or representatives of professional. My main duties are to maintain server's operation, security, and analyze and diagnose system hardware and software components. I also write up problem tickets with server's hardware and software and get clearance for vendors to have access to the servers for hardware repair as well as scheduling times with local I.R.S. personal and vendor to accomplish the repairs. I make sure when new server are to be put on the Domain I do all of the appropriate paper work which includes requesting UWR's, KISAM asset management to include all of the new servers information from serial numbers, bar code, make, model and location just to name few of them. I also file out the Server Compliance checklist, software license forms. In addition, I image or re-image server with the proper Windows Operating System and software needed to run the server e.g. Contact Recording, Contact Analytics, TOS, RTS among other servers. I also monitor and respond to KISAM Tickets I also monitor HIDS, Symantec Anti-Virus programs are up to date and operational. Insure all Microsoft Windows patches are installed on servers. I make sure Altiris is installed and the endpoint is healthy and if not I make the necessary corrections. I run Windows Policy Checker to insure the server stays with IRS and Cyber Security Compliance. If there are any that is not in compliance, I make the necessary changes to bring them back into compliance. I create documents in Word and Power Point in referencing to problems that I have encountered during trouble shooting a situation for other's in my group in case they have similar situations or problems and put them in our group shared location on the network for all to read. I also have done short training on things that I have encountered or I had more knowledge than others in my group via OSC in sharing on my conference calls. TPF Operations Server (TOS) I am the main system administrator and my accomplishments that I achieved was to set up a single sign on BAG group, single sign on to the IMM, from un-secure IMM Web page to a secure Web page and brought it current with the Big Fix patching. Installing and maintaining software and hardware, controlling current versions in use and future release of application software, and documenting the physical configuration of the system. Optimizing the functionality of servers systems using performance tuning tools and techniques. Analyze and Diagnosing and recovering failed systems using systems diagnosis tools and fault identification techniques. Planning and coordinating the installation of new products or equipment, resolving installation problems, identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities and risks, and maintaining server integrity and availability. Initiating corrective or preventive actions, such as increasing disk or memory capacity to improve system performance.
- System Administrator :: My responsibilities were to assist public electronic filing programmers by analyzing, diagnosing and making proposals on error in software to getting there software to passing the IRS standards for electronic filing. I did this by using IRS IRM and thereby have them transmit standard test returns then I would have to print out there transmitted test returns and analyses and determine where there programming error's were and call them and communicate to them where the error occurred. They would make the correction and it would be accepted as an Electronic Filing Software Program. I also work closely with the electronic filing Tax Examiners in assisting the transmitters in problem solving their situation. Another responsibility I had was to have all of the data copied to a nine-track tape and processed on the mainframe computer from that output then we had to drain the information on to an archival system that allowed the authorized I.R.S employees to access the returns if a taxpayer had questions about their returns. I also helped my group to maintain our network and desktop computers. There were times we would lose connection to the network and we would have to use a network sniffer that would assist us on the type and location of the problem that needed to be fixed. I also would install updates to the workstations, as they became available to us thru download transmittal.
- Information Technology Specialist :: Within my first 7 years I was able to go from a GS 3 Clerk position to the level of Systems Administrator GS -12 I achieved was to set up a single sign on BAG group, single sign on to the IMM, from un-secure IMM Web page to a secure Web page and brought it current with the Big Fix patching.
