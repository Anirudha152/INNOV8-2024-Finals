I manage the billings to our clients and follow through so that collection is made on time to ensure that the Company has the appropriate funds to settle the payables with subcontractors and other suppliers, salaries of the employees, and other expenses. On the financial reporting, I prepare detailed reports with supporting schedules such as 15-month expenditure budget with estimates and variations analysis, cash flows, Financial Packages and various management reports as are required by the head office.

In one of my individual tasks, I was able to isolate a management error in the way the Company has presented one of their major accounts and was able to formulate a solution to adjust the account and avoid future errors. This has enabled my Senior to trust that I can work diligently and as a consequence I was assigned one of the group's largest client. I have also observed different year-end inventory count procedures conducted by various clients to ensure the accuracy of the inventory that they report in their Financial Statements.
