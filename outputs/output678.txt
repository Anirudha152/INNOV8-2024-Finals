## Education:
- Bachelor of Science : Aerospace Engineering :: California State Polytechnic University
## Experience:
- Aviation Camp Assistant :: Assist children in building and flying model aircraft, launch rockets, complete flight simulation missions, and conduct flight-related science experiments. Assist in teaching course lessons based on aviation, air, and space topics Organize and prepare lesson materials and work directly with instructors during hands-on projects and activities. Supervise elementary school-aged campers during sign-in, sign-out, and break times. Supervised field trips to aviation-related locations. Work with a team comprised of diverse instructors, assistants, and volunteers to provide children an educational and unforgettable experience.
- Guest Experiences Specialist :: Offer superior service to potential and actual guests to the museum according to established procedures. Handle a large volume of in-person questions about The Tech Museum, exhibits, programs, films, special events as well as the downtown San Jose area. Be knowledgeable about The Tech Museum's mission, programs and exhibits and stay current with the functioning of the entire institution. Greet school groups by meeting teachers at buses outside the Group entrance, giving chaperone and student instructions to large groups Work collaboratively with other Guest Experiences staff, other museum staff and volunteers to provide an efficient and seamless experience for guests.
- Collaborating with others to meet mission requirements and accomplish objectives provided by the Northrop Grumman aerospace company. Part of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Simulations Team constructing models of the UAVs in order to obtain important aerodynamic properties to perform flight test simulations. Worked directly with the UAVs to take accurate measurements in order to model it. Designed accurate aerodynamic models of the UAVs using the program AVL, a program for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of rigid aircraft of arbitrary configuration. Modeled all lifting surfaces, control surfaces, and fuselage. Created data and run files of mass properties corresponding with each UAV. Executed the run files for each UAV in order to obtain a full linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight state with specified mass properties. Extracted stability-axis derivatives that will be imported into the flight simulation program, FlightGear, to model the simulated plane to have the same flight characteristics and behaviors as the UAVS. :: Collaborating with others to meet mission requirements and accomplish objectives provided by the Northrop Grumman aerospace company.

- Collaborating with a team to design and construct an aircraft that will be competing at the SAE Aero Design West. Sanded the balsa wood wings smooth for the preparation of carbon fiber wrapping. Prepared the epoxy resin mixture for application. Wrapped the leading edge, wing spars, fuselage molds, and fuselage walls with carbon fiber. Sawed and drill cutted fuselage components. :: Collaborating with a team to design and construct an aircraft that will be competing at the SAE Aero Design West.

- Performed as Team Leader for a team of four for the experimentation and analysis of flight dynamics and parameters of Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor Implemented low-speed wind and water tunnel testing using test models to obtain and investigate flight dynamics and performance characteristics. Analyzed the flow vortices over the wing at varying velocities at increasing angles of attacks. Calculated and observed the relationship and importance of the effect of Reynold's numbers on aerodynamic coefficients. Compiled a technical report detailing the results of the calculations and observations, and compared the accuracy of wind/water tunnel testing to theoretical F-22 characteristics. :: Performed as Team Leader for a team of four for the experimentation and analysis of flight dynamics and parameters of Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor Implemented low-speed wind and water tunnel testing using test models to obtain and investigate flight dynamics and performance characteristics.
