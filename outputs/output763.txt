## Education:
- Bachelor of Science : Business Administration :: University of the Ozarks

## Experience:
- Accountant :: Handled the day to day accounts payable, accounts receivable, monthly financial closing, work in process, and sales tax.
- Co-Owner :: Created a business plan to help preserve a historic landmark building and encourage economic development in Historic downtown Rogers. Created from scratch Poor Richard's Art (an artist co-op) and then purchased The Rabbit's Lair and turned it into a fabric & fiber center that became one of the top 10 shops in America. Handled all day to day operations, finances, management of employees, strategic planning, and worked with City of Rogers to help with beautification and implementation of events.
- Owner :: BKP was created after I had my daughter and wanted a more stay at home job. It turned into a bookkeeping/accounting firm that had 7 employees and over 120 different business customers. BKP specialized in small businesses that needed a bookkeeper to come to their site and keep their accounting records up-to-date and train them in the day-to-day accounting needs. BKP was sold to Beall-Barclay is 2005, where I became the Business Development Manager.
- Accounting Manager :: Hanna's was a company that had grown so fast it needed process, procedures, and software to bring it up to speed. While I was there we implemented new software, audits, and inventory controls for the retail shops.
- Cost Accounting Manager :: My job was to implement SAP software. Starbuck's was going through their manufacturing processes and creating a cost accounting system. It was a fabulous job, I just found the Seattle gray days too hard.
- Cost Accounting Manager :: I begin as a cost-accountant for the Irish Spring portion of manufacturing at the Kansas City, Ksplant. It was a time of change, automation of the manufacturing process, and upgrading software to SAP. This is where I fell in love with accounting and helping the manufacturing team understand how it worked for them or against them. During my time at Colgate, I was involved in the cost of unions, strikes, complete downsizing of administrative roles, different general managers of the facility, and working with New York on monthly reports and annual budgets. Other projects included the creation of the Cost Accounting system and processes with the CPA firm hired to implement the software. My counter-part and I flew up to NY each week to work on this and then flew back each Thursday to work on our regular jobs. Once SAP was up and running for Colgate, I was transferred to Hill's Pet Nutrition in Topeka, KS as the Cost Accounting Manager to implement SAP.
- Accounting Manager :: Speaco Foods was a manufacturing facility (multi-state) that made vinegar, juices, hot sauce and mustard. It was a family owned business that I worked at all my summers during high school and college. I worked in the manufacturing plants until I graduated college. Once I graduated college, I worked in the accounting department. I started in Accounts Payable, then receivables and then inventory control. My role in the accounting was to implement new software, train others, and get the inventory and cost accounting systems up and running. Before I left Speaco Foods, I became the Accounting Manager.
