## Education:
- Bachelor of Arts : Psychology :: Arizona State University
- Minor-Sociology :: Arizona State University

## Experience:
- Adventure Run Coordinator :: I am the coordinator for two of them, (the two available in Arizona).  The duties and commitments are at large variety.  As a representative and coordinator for the program, I am in charge of permitting for the event and charity beer garden, some levels of sponsorship and vendors.  Securing local vendors and sponsors as well as locations for post run celebrations.  Along with these responsibilities, I am in charge of setup and tear down.  I am on the mic during the event of about 500 people, manage up to 25 volunteers at a time during the event and effectively schedule them, and communicate details and important facts with the staff.  Other additional responsibilities are promoting the event to the surrounding running and fitness community.  I am required to be time efficient, extremely organized and prepped along with the ability to be flexible and overcome unexpected obstacles such as weather changes, cancellations, people running late and being short staffed all while remaining calm and high energetic. 
- Grassroots Marketing Representative :: I am the community outlet for both Arizona stores and am in charge of booking group runs, clinics for local teams and packet pick ups for races.  I reach out to local gyms and community vendors, charity partners that could have potential partnerships with Road Runner Sports and figure out the best fit for both parties.  I also am in charge of managing my own schedule and both Arizona's stores event calendars as well as a budget for the store's events. 
- Cash Wrap :: Help customers, new runners and old, find the best items to fit their needs.  Also, make recommendations and answer any questions in regards to the customer's running.  Multitask while checking customers out, answering phone questions and in person. 
- Operations :: Greet and check all members of gym in after opening up the facility alone.  I also answer all incoming calls and either help assist with their concerns and questions or direct them to another associate.  I sign in and ring up guests, make appointments for a variety of services and cancel, and renew memberships.  This requires me to be very successful at multitasking and a leader.  I must always be on time and have a positive upbeat attitude and always am required to think of the customer first.  As it being a company that portrays healthy lifestyles, as an employee of the company are preferred to maintain one as well through physical activity at the facility, thus I am knowledgeable and passionate about it as well.  As well as work 8 hours a week in the childcare with children from the age of 3 months to 12 years old. 
- Front Desk Fitness Attendant :: During the Summer Kid's Camp I work as an Advisor where I plan daily team and individual activities, help with lunch process and swim sessions, oversee the children's participation and interact with them.  As a Sports Club team member, I make promotional calls for the member sales department, monitor nursery, and monitor pool.  In July, I work the DSL Swim Championships where I am required to support facility needs for each team; direct spectators to appropriate areas, maintain a clean, safe event site, and answer general questions.  Working with people one-on- one and the general public is second nature in this environment as I consistently address different questions and problems regularly. As an attendant, I work the front desk of the fitness center and monitor member's use of gym.  Other duties include:  Keeping equipment and fitness/ weight room, and towels clean and orderly, assist members with other questions that are frequently asked; make smoothies, work snack bar, conduct sales in sports shop.
