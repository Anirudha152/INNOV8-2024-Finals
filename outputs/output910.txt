## Experience:
- Director of Programming Arts :: Responsible for the cultural arts activities at multiple venues. The Cox Performing Arts Center (1200 seats) is the home of the Celebrity Concert Series (CCS) which has been the premier performing arts series in the area since 1958. I am responsible for the management of the CCS and my duties include overseeing all programming, marketing, hospitality, financial accounts, administration, and fulfillment. I am also responsible for interacting with and guiding the CCS Board of Directors comprised of community leaders and performing arts enthusiasts. The CCS plays host to a wide variety of entertainment genres. Our current season includes Manhattan Transfer with Take 6, the Utah Symphony, The Drifters, GENTRI, and Canadian Brass to name a few. I am also responsible, during the summer months, for all facets of programming and management of the Tanner Amphitheater (1600 seats) in Springdale, Utah at the entrance to Zion National Park. Before I came to DSU, this outdoor theater was used for a handful of local artists playing weekend shows on a bare stage. I have completely rethought this venue by adding visual design elements, incorporating concessions and catering, seeking and obtaining permits to serve alcohol, and structuring the programming around two series formats. The first series is comprised of festival-style events where each performance date is focused on a specific genre of music and marketed as a standalone event with multiple artists hired for each show. The results have been miraculous as we turned a poorly attended series into an important, well-attended festival that was supported both by the community and the tourists staying in Springdale as part of their vacation to Zion National Park.  The second series is an original show called, "Sanctuary: The Story of Zion" which was written to correspond with the centennial celebration of our National Parks. I co-created, produced, and directed the show as well as assembled and hired the performance and tech team. This show was based on feedback we received from the area business owners when asked what kind of entertainment would best be supported by the tourists who come to the area. Sanctuary tells the story of Zion National Park though storytelling, music, and the unique usage of video projection to share testimonials of many prominent Zion Park officials as well as world-class artists and climbers who call Zion home.
- Board of Directors Member :: SUSWA continues to be a creative force in the Southern Utah area by providing a platform for an active group of like-minded individuals interested in the art of songwriting and performance. SUSWA plans and implements various clinics for its membership throughout the year. As well, we create and manage multiple concert series each year in St George, Utah.
- Operations Manager :: As Operations Manager/Owner of Spiral Studios, I was responsible for the daily management of a busy commercial recording studio. From serving area musicians in a state-of-the-art studio, to creating production music that has been featured on such networks as Discovery, Disney, A&E, and many others, I managed each of these activities along with a talented staff of creative minded engineers and musicians.  Spiral Studios has also been involved with many festival-style shows by hiring and managing artists and providing A/V equipment.  In my time at Spiral Studios, I was able to create many industry relationships with both entertainers and management.  These relationships have allowed for a deep understanding of performing arts from the perspective of an entertainer as well as a director.  This knowledge informs my decisions and gives me a unique perspective in my role as Director of Programming.  I continue to own Spiral Studios but have turned day-to-day operations over to a studio manager and a staff of creative engineers.
- Musician :: As a touring/performing musician, I have had the opportunity to travel the world.  This musical ability has been the backbone of my career as I have transitioned from performing to audio engineering to managing performing arts facilities and concert series.  This experience allows the unique position of a deep understanding of multiple sides of the industry.  As I communicate with touring musicians, I have an intimate knowledge of the challenges they face.  I completely understand the technical demands and needs of the events I manage.  Lastly, I have a firm grasp on marketing and management, which has been central to my 25 year career.
