## Education:
- GRADUATE :: John Wood Community College
- High School :: Quincy Senior High School

## Experience:
- Production Supervisor / Value Stream Leader :: Responsible for daily production needs within the basic compressor build lines. Reviewed production orders, schedules, delivery dates and inventory levels to determine product availability. Mastered the intricacies of the process flow within each department. Established and adjusted work procedures to meet production schedules. Supervised production schedules, production quality and on time delivery. Reviewed production orders, schedules, delivery dates and inventory levels to determine product availability. Implemented root cause and corrective actions to remove production constraints and improve product quality. Improved efficiency and productivity by eliminating waste and production constraints. Organized, prioritized and managed plant maintenance projects to keep facility safe, efficient and clean.
- ENGINEERING LAB MANAGER :: Responsible for building and assembling test compressors and auxiliary test equipment, recording test procedures and results, and making recommendations for changes in equipment, product, and/or test methods.Perform tests using standard engineering test procedures and equipment without supervision such as performance test, oil carryover, vibration and noise testing. Resolve routine instrumentation and testing problems or malfunctions. Make recommendations for changes / improvements to products to reduce cost or enhance quality. Coordinated and developed new product design in collaboration with engineering staff.Completed key projects on time, on budget and with a high level of accuracy. Implemented root cause and corrective actions to remove production constraints and improve product quality.
- PROCESS TECHNICIAN :: Develop and document standard operational methods to improve repeatability and quality in manufacturing. Work closely with warranty team and manufacturing groups to implement corrective measures into the standard operational methods as needed. Emphasis will be on visual controls methods and job instructions for training and qualifications purposes. Work closely with the natural work groups, value stream leaders, quality engineers and manufacturing engineers.
- MACHINIST/ASSEMBLER :: Job duties include building of several types of air compressors from single-stage to two- stage compressors. Troubleshooting and correcting any problems that may arise during assembly. Running numerous types of machinery, from CNC machining centers to CNC lathes, automatic and manual lathes, crankshaft grinders to various types of drills. Worked with close tolerances on all machined parts from rough castings to finished products ready for assembly. Have experience in blue print reading and schematics also.
- AVIATION ORDNANCEMAN :: Preformed maintenance on the S-3B Viking aircraft while stationed Various duties included general maintenance of the aircraft, repair of broken wires, reading of blueprints and schematics, computer checks, repair of several different control boxes that are connected to the computers which operate on the systems that was related to my field of work. Treating and preserving the aircraft from different types of corrosion, loading of different types of ordinance, such as bombs, missals, and various types of counter measure equipment. Obtained several types of licenses that pertained to my field, such as ordnance driver which allowed transportation of bombs and missiles from holding areas final destination for loading. Many types of release checks which included testing the aircraft to make sure that weapons loaded would release properly in a safe condition. Upkeep of equipment that needed calibration.
