- Research Associate :: Study of Tera Spectra and Tera imaging. Analytical testing and method development and method validation. THz imaging for nanotechnology: The relationship between nanotechnology and THz is bidirectional, in the sense that the concurrent developments can contribute to both technologies. THz modalities have helped the expansion of nanotechnology. Maintenance and Calibration of Analytical Instruments such as HPLC, UPLC, UV, FT-IR, Dissolution apparatus, pH meter and analytical balances. Nanotechnology could help in the development of high-resolution, sensitive and portable detectors and new efficient sources for THz imaging purposes. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods used in submillimeter diameter capillaries and in micro and nanofluidic channels. Performed the Biotechnology techniques cytogenetics and PCR methods. Created Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for instrumental analysis. Fundamental lab procedures including pipetting, buffer preparation, weighing. Recorded laboratory data and graphed the results to identify significant variations. Prepared reports complying with FDA, ISO, cGMP and internal regulations; and coordinated material, instrument and process validations. Maintained lab set up by ordering common supplies and chemicals.
- Research Associate :: Determine their thickness profile. Analytical testing and method development and method validation. Confirming the ability of this technique to resolve small variations in Ti02 layer thickness and consequently adsorption. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) methods used in submillimeter diameter capillaries and in micro- and nanofluidic channels. Chromatographic techniques (GC). Developed new analytical methods based on testing results. Created Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for instrumental analysis. Performed a variety of technical laboratory functions in the operation and maintenance of laboratory equipment calibrating. Prepared reports complying with FDA, ISO, cGMP and internal regulations and coordinated material, instrument and process validations. Maintenance and Calibration of Analytical Instruments such as HPLC, UPLC, UV, FT-IR, Dissolution apparatus, pH meter and analytical balances. Fundamental lab procedures including pipetting, buffer preparation, weighing. Essential to develop a new compound of antibiotics.
- Research Associate :: Isolation, identification, Bioprocessing and characterization of secondary metabolites from the soil screened microorganism. Screening of soil actinomycetes from the different soil samples. Taxonomical studies for antibiotic producing isolates. Morphological and cultural characterization. Total genomic DNA isolation & PCR & Cloning of polyene CYP gene (cytochrome P-450 hydroxlase). Bioprocessing for antibiotic production. Biological activity such as Antimicrobial activity, cytotoxic activity, Genotoxic activity. Research will be constant requirement for new antibiotic compounds to overcome the resistant capacity in microorganisms.
