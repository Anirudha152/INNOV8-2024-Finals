## Experience:
- Director of Information Technology :: Provided application and network support services for the MSBA. The MSBA is a small quasi-public state authority who financially assists school districts in their school building projects. My group maintains a rackspace hosted asp.net solution tied to SQL Server. I had all the hardware and software refreshed as well as bringing the development group up to sql server, tfs, and VS 2012. I personally rewrote their utility and security library from VB.NET to C# and added many more classes to support more static helper functions. I also developed an architecture based on object modeling for a middle tier. I was the the login account administrator for the authority which utilized Santander Banking Services. I wore many hats with my team - developer, manager, network administration and help desk. I served as the project manager for all current projects and provided business analysis to work out business workflows for my team. I recommended Tableau as the authority's visualization business intelligence tool. We just started developing the infrastructure around the new business intelligence tool. We finished bringing in DSCI for data and phone lines and we are ready to have our phone system hosted in their data center.
- Team Leader :: Lead clinical and research programming development and application support for applications developed by my group for the Cardiovascular Program. I had three teams under my leadership. I had the CAS and later the EMERIS group and I project managed the effort to replace a number of legacy systems with modern C# applications. The second group maintained professional and clinical billing for the cardiology department. The third group developed and maintained research applications for the cardiology's research department. I was the logical Oracle DBA who puts objects into production and I maintained our central job scheduler and placed those jobs into production as well.
- Chief Information Officer :: Provide network, application and help desk support for the largest agency in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, The Department of Mental Retardation. The agency is now called the Department of Developmental Services and at that time my network team of 5 managed the the entire state of Massachusetts office: 30 field office and 5 state school facilities. We upgraded to Zen 5.0 of Novell and remotely managed our desktops. We also developed client server model applications and the electronic service delivery model which was hosted in our facility with ITD's assistance. Our development platform was classic asp with vb.net and the back end was sql server.
- Director of Applications Development :: Provided application development and support services to the Department of Youth Services. I lead the Year 2000. project to convert our Natural/Adabas mainframe system to a ASP web based application YSIS. I also helped out as a. banyan administrator to our Network Administrator.
